You are an ML engineer. Your task is to analyze a training log file to find the best-performing model checkpoint.

The log file is located at `data/train.log`.

You must:
1.  Read the `data/train.log` file.
2.  Parse ONLY the lines that start with `[EPOCH_SUMMARY]`. Ignore all other lines.
3.  Find the epoch that has the **lowest `val_loss`**.
4.  Create a new file named `results.json` in the current directory.
5.  This JSON file must contain the following information for that single best epoch:
    * `best_epoch` (as an integer)
    * `train_loss` (as a float)
    * `val_loss` (as a float)

For example, if Epoch 10 was best, the file might look like:
{
    "best_epoch": 10,
    "train_loss": 0.25,
    "val_loss": 0.12
}

You have access to standard filesystem tools (like `read_file`, `write_file`) and a Python interpreter.
